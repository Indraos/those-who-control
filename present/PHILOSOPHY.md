Indentity is not fixed but continuously reconstructred through the narrative we set. 
Our conversational interface recognizes this and pushes the user to engage in a recreational narrative-based act: 

1. **Mirroring**: Reflects current patterns without judgment
2. **Excavation**: Surfaces unexamined assumptions and inherited patterns
3. **Confrontation**: Gently challenges rationalization and avoidance
4. **Integration**: Guides toward concrete, actionable change

This progression mirrors **Socratic dialogue** (questioning assumptions), **motivational interviewing** (change talk elicitation), and **existential therapy** (confronting choice and responsibility).
