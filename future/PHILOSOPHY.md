# PHILOSOPHY.md - Future

## Conceptual Foundation
For us, the future is undefined. The future that we imagine becomes our reality - recollection of the past and imagination of the future are connected in that they are based on what we believe happened or will happen. Each of them, however, tells us that "this matters to me." This implementation explores how AI image generation can make explicit what photography has always done implicitly: construct alternate realities where we exist differently - showcase our future in the many possible selves that it could bring together. 

## Theoretical Framework

### Photography and Fabricated Memory

Drawing on:
- **Roland Barthes, *Camera Lucida***: Photography as evidence of "having-been-there"
- **Susan Sontag, *On Photography***: The camera as tool of appropriation and transformation
- **Vilém Flusser, *Towards a Philosophy of Photography***: Technical images as encoded ideology

The AI-generated images are **explicitly fictional futures**: you at the beach you've never visited (yet), the wedding that never happened (yet), the funeral not held (yet). They are no more or less "real" than the staged photos we already call memories.

### The Photobooth as Liminal Ritual

The photobooth is a modern **rite of passage**:
- **Separation**: Step into the booth, away from the crowd
- **Liminality**: Face the camera, perform for yourself
- **Incorporation**: Emerge with artifact (photo strip) as evidence of transformation

Traditional photobooths capture "you as you are." This photobooth generates **you as you might be**—aspirational, feared, imagined, impossible selves.

### Possible Worlds and Counterfactual Selves

Philosophical framework from:

- **David Lewis, "On the Plurality of Worlds"**: Modal realism—possible worlds are as real as the actual world
- **Derek Parfit, *Reasons and Persons***: Personal identity through hypothetical scenarios
- **Jennifer Nagel, "The Psychological Basis of the Harman-Vogel Paradox"**: Imagination as epistemic tool

Each generated image is a **possible world** where you made different choices, experienced different events, became a different person. These are not fantasies—they are **epistemically accessible alternatives**. You could have that beach vacation. You might have that wedding. You will have that funeral.

By materializing these counterfactual selves, the work makes explicit the **branching garden of forking paths** that constitutes a life. You are not one person—you are the superposition of all people you could have been.

## The Four Scenes: Archetypal Futures

### 1. Beach Vacation (Leisure/Escape)

**Cultural Archetype**: The vacation photo as proof of successful life
- **Semiotics**: Beach = freedom, leisure class, escape from labor
- **Ideology**: "You deserve this" (consumer capitalism)
- **Question Posed**: What would you look like free?

### 2. Wedding (Commitment/Transformation)

**Cultural Archetype**: The wedding photo as life milestone
- **Semiotics**: Wedding = social legitimacy, heteronormative script, "before/after" identity shift
- **Ideology**: Marriage as pinnacle of personal achievement
- **Question Posed**: What would you look like choosing?

### 3. Old Restaurant (Memory/Nostalgia)

**Cultural Archetype**: The family dinner photo as continuity
- **Semiotics**: Restaurant = gathering, tradition, intergenerational connection
- **Ideology**: Stability through ritual repetition
- **Question Posed**: What would you look like rooted?

### 4. Funeral (Mortality/Legacy)

**Cultural Archetype**: The memorial photo as evidence of existence
- **Semiotics**: Funeral = finality, social mourning, legacy construction
- **Ideology**: Life measured by who shows up when you're gone
- **Question Posed**: What would you look like remembered?

These are not arbitrary scenarios. They are the **culturally mandated milestone photographs**—the images we're told constitute a complete life. By generating them artificially, the work asks: what is lost when we simulate the moments we're supposed to accumulate "naturally"?

## The Print as Material Artifact

### Instant Gratification and Delayed Meaning

The print emerges immediately (via CUPS USB printer)—instant materialization of imagined future. But its **meaning unfolds over time**:

- Day 1: "This is funny/weird"
- Week 1: "This is unsettling"
- Month 1: "This is prescient" or "This is impossible"
- Year 1: "This is what didn't happen" or "This is what almost happened"

The print becomes a **temporal anchor**—you measure your actual life against the futures the AI generated. Did you have the beach vacation? Did you get married? Did you maintain tradition? The photograph becomes oracle, mirror, and accusation.

## Ethical Dimensions

### Consent and Self-Commodification

Participants consent to:
1. Being photographed (traditional)
2. Having their image algorithmically transformed (new)
3. Receiving speculative futures they did not request (provocative)

This reverses typical AI ethics concerns. The participant **wants** to be deepfaked into fictional scenarios. They are complicit in their own digital transformation.

## Future as Present Tense

The title "Who Controls the Future" is grammatically incorrect. Futures are not controlled—they are **imagined, projected, feared, hoped, constructed**.

But the moment you receive the generated image, that future enters your present. You now carry it. It lives in your wallet, your phone photos, your memory. The future has already arrived—not as reality, but as **possibility you cannot un-see**.

This is the work's transformation: not changing the future, but changing your present by making the future visible.
