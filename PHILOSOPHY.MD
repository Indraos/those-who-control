# WHO CONTROLS THE PRESENT. 

"Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past." -- George Orwell. 

We remember our past in the form of memories - the best friend we had in college, the first job we had, the latest fight with our parents. Our memories can describe our current state in life. Our interpretation of them can tell us who we are right now and what narratives we tell ourselves or are conditioned to tell ourselves. 

Who sets what you believe right now? Who sets how you remember your past? Who sets how you conceptualize your future? 
The human's conception of past, present, and future is beautifully continuous and malleable. 

We tell ourselves our own narratives: "I've always been shy." "I've always been a designer." "I always listen." Some of these narratives build our identity and with our identity our strong anchoring in this life and its purpose. More often than not we are not aware of the narratives we tell ourselves and how they shape our own spacetime - our past, our present, and our future. 

Apart from our own lack of awareness: What is the culture - the external influences - that makes us believe in these narratives? 
What do we **want** to believe? Where are we just hiding from more questioning of what the truth about ourselves may be?
We have to cognitively protect ourselves from the narratives we are made to believe about ourselves, our own (selfish) desires to take control of our past and associated memories, and our anxiety holding us back from creating a future in which we are fulfilled. 

This installation aims to challenge your beliefs about your own narrative, enabling awareness, and wonderous discomfort. 
You will be going through 3 main stations: Future, Past, and Present. 

Each of these stations is enhanced through technology, hoping to challenge each of the current parts of your life. 
For each of them, there is a "Philosophy.md" and "Technology.md" file that you can read to understand what is going on. Please be respectful of the devices you'll be interacting with. 

Enjoy!
