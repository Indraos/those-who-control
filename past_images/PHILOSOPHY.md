# PHILOSOPHY.md - Past Images

Our memories inform our present and our present informs our memories. Every photograph has captured a snapshot of our reality that has become memory. At the same time, every phototgraph is an act of selective forgetting-choosing this angle, this moment, this framing, which inherently excludes the uncaptured moment, the untold stories, or the stories we chose to forget. 
Sometimes we selectively erase the very people who were the most important and therefore, the most complicated in our life stories. This piece asks: what happens when we erase the very people who populate our memories? Some thinkers related to this are:

- **Roland Barthes, *Camera Lucida***: The photograph as proof of "that-has-been"
- **Jacques Derrida, "Archive Fever"**: Presence always contains its own absence
- **Eduardo Cadava, *Words of Light***: Photography as medium of loss and mourning

The photograph preserves the moment, as if it was screaming: "I was here." Yet, we mourn when we look at photographs, knowing that the moment can never return. This work hopes to make the complexity of mourning and re-narrativization of memory literal. 

By computationally removing a person from photographs, we create **visible absence**—the space where they were, the outline of their former presence. The emptiness is not neutral; it is **haunting**.

### Digital Erasure vs. Historical Erasure

**Soviet-style photo manipulation**: Airbrush political enemies from official records to rewrite history
**This work**: User-initiated erasure of personal relationships to rewrite memory

The distinction is critical:
- **Authoritarian erasure**: Imposed from above, denies existence, reframes collective truth
- **Personal erasure**: Self-directed, acknowledges pain, reframes individual narrative

When we remove any person from a factually occurred event ("I was there."), what does our life look like? What does our life look like in which we do not acknowledge the presence of our past and its gravity for the present. 

### The Ethics of Computational Forgetting

**Right to be Forgotten (GDPR)**: Legal framework for removing personal data
**This work**: Technological framework for removing personal presence from visual history

But the erasure is never complete. The AI fills the gap—inpaints grass where they stood, extends the table where they sat, continues the wall behind them. The replacement is seamless but synthetic. The image says "this person was not here," but the metadata (if examined) reveals intervention.

**Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, *Delete***: Digital memory is permanent by default; forgetting requires active work
**This tool**: Makes forgetting visible as labor—upload, detect, segment, inpaint, download

## Psychological and Relational Dimensions

### Breakups, Estrangements, Losses

**Potential Usage scenarios:**
- Divorce: Remove ex-spouse from wedding photos, family albums
- Estrangement: Erase abusive parent from childhood memories
- Death: Create alternate timeline where deceased is not present (or conversely, where their absence is visualized)

Each case has different emotional valence:
- **Divorce**: Reclaiming narrative ("I was there, they weren't")
- **Estrangement**: Protective deletion ("Safer to unsee them")
- **Death**: Complicated mourning ("What if they'd never been there?")

**Neuroscience**: Memory reconsolidation—each time we recall a memory, we alter it
**This work**: Visual reconsolidation—algorithmically altering the record, which then alters memory
